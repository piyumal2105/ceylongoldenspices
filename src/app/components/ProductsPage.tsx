    fullDescription: 'Our Pure Ceylon Whole Cloves are meticulously hand-harvested from Syzygium aromaticum trees thriving in the fertile, humid lowlands and mid-elevations of Sri Lanka. Each clove is carefully selected at peak maturity — when the bud transitions from green to a vivid rose-pink — ensuring maximum essential oil content and the strongest, most complex aroma profile. Ceylon cloves are globally prized for their exceptionally high eugenol concentration (up to 90%), which imparts their signature warm, woody, and slightly sweet flavour. Unlike mass-market alternatives, our cloves are sun-dried using traditional slow-drying methods to preserve volatile compounds and prevent mould without chemical intervention.',

    fullDescription: 'Ceylon Cinnamon — Cinnamomum verum — is the only true cinnamon in the world, and Sri Lanka produces over 80% of the global supply. Our quills are hand-crafted by skilled cinnamon peelers (known as "chalias") who have inherited the art over centuries. The inner bark is carefully peeled, layered, and hand-rolled into signature multi-layered quills with a papery-thin texture unique to genuine Ceylon cinnamon. What sets Ceylon apart from the widely sold Cassia cinnamon is its dramatically lower coumarin content (0.04% vs. up to 1% in Cassia), making it far safer for daily consumption.',
